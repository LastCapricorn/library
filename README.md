# Library

## Third project of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Course

I read the assignment on TOP for this project and I don't know why, suddenly felt like knowing absolutely nothing about web development. So I started some exercises in a folder I called "library gymnastics". I had a pretty good idea what my library should be able to do and as almost always, I had set too high standards for myself. But that's how the "library gymnastics" quickly became a big part of this project...
