# Library

## Third project of The Odin Project's Full Stack JavaScript Course

I read the assignment on TOP for this project and I don't know why, suddenly felt like knowing absolutely nothing about web development. So I started some exercises in a folder I called "library gymnastics". I had a pretty good idea what my library should be able to do and as almost always, I had set too high standards for myself. But that's how the "library gymnastics" quickly became a big part of this project.

Finally solved the issues with those switch buttons - feeling more than ever terribly stupid...

Woo-hoo - think I'm done now! This one gave a little taste of how much work there will be in a real real-life-project in future. It gets increasingly difficult to keep track - time is getting closer when I can't start off head over heals...
